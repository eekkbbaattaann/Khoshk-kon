<MANUAL>
This screen concerns the inspection of the wire carriage and the wire
insertion, based on  :
- the wire carriage inspection : left and right sensors on the wire path
- the inspection of the wire insertion : sensor that is damped when a wire is inserted
 
 
LEARNING PHASE :
This part of the screen displays information measured during the learning
phase, i.e. during the wire inspection synchronization.
 
During the learning phase, the positions at which each sensor is damped are
measured. Here : 
- WCL : is the left sensor on the wire carriage path
- WCR : is the right sensor on the wire carriage path
- WIN : is the sensor that is damped when the wire is inserted
 
The sensors and the corresponding positions are represented from the top to
the bottom, in the order as they were damped during synchronization.
For instance :
- WCR 284° : first sensor, damped at position 284°
- WCR 136° : next sensor, damped at position 136°
- WCL 242° : next sensor, damped at position 242°
- WIN 348° : next sensor, damped at position 348°
- WCL  88° : last sensor, damped at position 88°
 
Depending on the wire motion phase in which the synchronization is started,
the sequence with another sensor is started.

 
 
INSPECTION PHASE :
This part of the screen displays information, needed for the inspection of
the wire carriage and the wire insertion.
 
Depending on the wire insertion or retraction, it is indicated
- for each of the sensors in which zone it should be damped, otherwise the
  machine stops, generating an error message.
     Example : ins. WCR 126°-146°
     indicates that during the insertion of the wire, the right sensor on 
     the wire path must be damped between 126° and 146°.
- which sensor actually was damped in each of the zones
     Example :                   WCR WCL WIN
               extr. WCL 78°-98°  0   1   0
     indicates that between 78° and 98°
     - the right sensor on the wire path was not damped (0)
     - the left sensor on the wire path was damped (1)
     - the sensor for the inserted wire was not damped (0)
     As this corresponds to the expected sensor (WCL), everything is OK and
     the machine will not stop.
 
The zones are determined based on the positions measured during the
learning phase.
