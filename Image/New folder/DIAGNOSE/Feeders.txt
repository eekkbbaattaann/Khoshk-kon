++ PATTERN PRE-ORIENTATION (PPO control)
prew_ppo_control
<MANUAL>

Feeder 1: 
Feeder number (= connector number on the controlbox). Press 'next' to select next feeder.
 
TOP color 01: 
the position and color for which this feeder is used
 
NODE STATUS: 
05 = operational / 127 = pre-operational / 128 = no communication with feeder
 
STARTUP STATUS: 
0 = started up / > 0 = status at startup error
1: startup requested : no communication with node within 10 sec after power on
2: asking device type failed or wrong device type (must be 414/01)
3: asking device vendor failed or unsupported vendor (must be 160 = IRO)
4: reading feederfunctions failed
5: setting feederfunctions failed
6: setting insertion type failed
7: setting number of increments failed
8: setting color assignment failed
9: tensioner setup failed
11:asking feederstate failed
12: start node : node not operational within 5 seconds after start command
14: pickinsertion mode not supported
15: sending PPO control failed
 
FEEDER STATUS (6009h):
00: operational mode
01: positioning mode
02: filling up to maximum sensor
04: non operational mode
06: initializing mode
07: error mode
08: switch in OFF position
09: bobbin break
 
FEEDER ERROR (6007h)
when a feeder error is active the red led on the feeder flashes.
00: operational - no error
01: no settings available in EEPROM
02: switch in OFF position
03: weaving machine parameters missing
04: yarn is broken
05: feeder is running empty
06: temperature too high
07: motor voltage not OK
08: no communication with EEPROM
09: rotation not possible/motor lock
0A: filling up failed
0B: color information missing. Activated by automatic brake test. Error is cleared when loom is started.
0C: angle trigger signal missing
0F: general error
 
ERROR REGISTER:
0 = no errors active 
>0 = errors active. More details in "Feeder status" and "feeder error"
 
SDO ABORT CODE: reason while data-transmission failed. 00000000 = no failures.
 
PATTERN PRE-ORIENTATION: 
ON: the feeder uses the pickinsertion data to optimize his speed
OFF: the feeder works as a standalone feeder (connection and startup must be OK!)
